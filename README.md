 # Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive system using machine learning to classify sonar signals as either a **rock** or a **mine**. The objective is to train a model that can help submarines distinguish between benign rocks and hazardous mines in underwater navigation.

## Objectives

- Understand and analyze sonar data to distinguish between rocks and mines.
- Develop a predictive model using supervised learning techniques.
- Evaluate the model's performance on training and testing datasets.
- Build a system that can classify new sonar signals with high accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Sonar data collected from experiments involving rocks and metal cylinders representing mines.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and analyzed the raw data to identify important statistical features.
3. **Model Training**: Used **Logistic Regression** for binary classification of sonar signals.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Split the dataset into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets to assess model performance.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for implementing the machine learning pipeline and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Logistic Regression model and performance evaluation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data transformations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-rock-vs-mine.git
    cd sonar-rock-vs-mine
    ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the script for data analysis and model training:
    ```bash
    python sonar_prediction.py
    ```

## Usage

- The script `sonar_prediction.py` loads the sonar data, processes it, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance.
- The model outputs accuracy metrics and predictions on whether a sonar signal is a rock (`r`) or a mine (`m`).

## Results

- **Accuracy**: Achieved **83.4% accuracy** on the training dataset and **76% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- **Insights**: Effective at classifying sonar signals into rock and mine categories.
- **Real-world Application**: Practical system for use in submarines to aid underwater navigation in dangerous areas.

## Key Achievements

- Built a reliable sonar classification system with significant real-world applications.
- Demonstrated hands-on experience with logistic regression for binary classification problems.
- Provided insights into sonar data feature importance and model performance.
